Welcome to the FrostOS Developer Console!
As you may aware, this operating system is still under development and continuing to do so.

To return to the browser, press:

 [ Ctrl ] and [ Alt ] and [ <- ] (F1)

To use this console, developer mode must be enabled.
Doing so will destroy any saved data on the system.

In developer mode, It is possible to
- login and sudo as user
- require a password for sudo and login
- disable power management behavior (screen dimming):
  sudo initctl stop powerd
- install your own operating system image!

Have fun and send patches!
